# list 
var1 = "A"
var2 = "B"
var3 = "C"
# print(f"{var1,var3,var2}")
# not single
# list store data as list with single variable 
# variable = ["A","B","C"]
# print(variable) # []

# fruits = [1,2,3,9,5,2,4,6,9]

# # A to Z 
# text = ["A","N","B","T","C"]
# fruits.reverse()
# print(fruits) # 1,2,3 or 3,2,1

# # practice testing All methods in list 

# text1 = ["A"]
# # print(textForCopy)
# textCopy = text.copy()
# print("Text Copy From list :",textCopy)
# print()
# print("Text Copy From list :",textCopy)
